# Machine_Learning_Car_Detection
Comparing ML methods to see how efficient some tools can detectspecific cars

Summary of this Detection tool:
This tool researches different YOLO models, i.e., YOLOv3, YOLOv4,
and YOLOv5, as well as RCNN models with different baselines, i.e., VGG16,
ResNet50, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB7. Based on the theoretical analysis, several experiments were conducted. 
Firstly, an automobile dataset from Kaggle is collected. Next, seven models are implemented, utilizing their pretrained weights, 
and training them successfully on the dataset. Then, their performance is compared and the results are qualitatively and quantitatively
analyzed. Next, the best model (YOLOv5) is seleceted to test its performance on the unseen videos and sports
car images.
